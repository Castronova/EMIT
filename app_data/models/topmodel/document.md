# TOPMODEL

----

## Overview
**TOPMODEL** is a physically based, distributed watershed model that simulates hydrologic fluxes of water (infiltration-excess overland flow, saturation overland flow, infiltration, exfiltration, subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, and channel routing) through a watershed.
The model simulates explicit groundwater/surface- water interactions by predicting the movement of the water table, which determines where saturated land-surface areas develop and have the potential to produce saturation overland flow.

### Model Inputs
* #### Topographic Index
> ASCII raster representing topographic indices for every gridcell in the watershed
* #### Flow Accumulation
> ASCII raster representing the flow accumulation for each cell in the watershed
* #### Interception
> Loss of rainfall due to interception
* #### Saturated Soil Transmissivity
> Soil transmissivity
* #### Recession Coefficient
> Groundwater recession coefficient
* #### Scaling Paramter
> Dimensionless scaling parameter
