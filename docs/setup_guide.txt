Progress on the installer

setup.py contains the code that sets up the installer.  If it works properly it will also grab all of the packages like wx, gdal, matplotlib, etc.
The setup.py has a similar design to ODM2StreamingDataLoader and ODMToolsPython.  They are called setup.py and make.py respectifully on github.

From the terminal run the follow:
1. python setup.py       This will create a folder on the directory called setup.  This is supposed to contain the .app file but there are issues

Another technique I have tried is doing the following the in the terminal:
1. pyinstaller EMIT.py --windowed --clean       This will create two folders dist and build.  The .app file is in the dist folder but it does not execute so
            open it then Contents/MacOS/ then look for the EMIT executable.  This may or may not run.

Issues I have had are that certain packages or directories do not exist even though they do.
